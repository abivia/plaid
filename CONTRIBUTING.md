# Contributing

We encourage all contributions to abivia/plaid. This includes bug reports, documentation updates,
suggestions, and most of all code.

Security issues should be sent by email to [foss@abivia.com](mailto:foss@abivia.com).

## Code Contributions

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept code contributions via Pull Requests on Github.

- Follow project coding standards.
- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.
- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant
  documentation are kept up-to-date.
- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly
  breaking public APIs is not an option.
- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.
- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull
  requests.
- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful.
  If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing,
  please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages)
  before submitting.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the Contributor Code of Conduct
(see below). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable
behavior to [foss@abivia.com](mailto:foss@abivia.com).

## Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers
pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity
and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit
  permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are
expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable
behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits,
code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or
to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is
representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or
community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media
account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a
project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting
the project at [foss@abivia.com](mailto:foss@abivia.com). All complaints will be reviewed
and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the
circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter
of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face
temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

### Attribution

the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 1.4, available
